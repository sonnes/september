# Package Manager Rule

This project uses **Bun** as its package manager.

- All package management commands (install, run, etc.) should use `pnpm` instead of `npm` or `yarn`.
- Update documentation and scripts to reference `bun` where appropriate.

**Example:**

```sh
# Good
pnpm install
pnpm run dev

# Bad
npm install
yarn install
```

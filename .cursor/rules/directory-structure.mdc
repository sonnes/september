## Important: Always Read README Files

**Before working in any directory, ALWAYS read the README.md file in that directory first.** Each major directory contains a README with:

- Directory purpose and organization
- Key files and their responsibilities
- Architecture patterns specific to that area
- Links to relevant files for reference

This ensures you understand the context and patterns before making changes.

### Data Structures

**Autocomplete Library:**

- Simple object-based storage
- Basic frequency counting
- Limited metadata

**Suggestions Library:**

- Trie data structure for completions
- N-gram models (bigram/trigram)
- Rich metadata with confidence scores
- Context tracking
- Frequency analysis

## Performance Comparison

### Memory Usage

- **Autocomplete**: Lower memory footprint, suitable for simple use cases
- **Suggestions**: Higher memory usage due to richer data structures, but more efficient for large datasets

### Speed

- **Autocomplete**: Good performance for basic operations
- **Suggestions**: Optimized with Trie structures, faster for prefix matching

### Scalability

- **Autocomplete**: Limited scalability for large corpora
- **Suggestions**: Better scalability with efficient data structures

## Use Case Recommendations

### Choose Autocomplete Library When:

- ✅ You need simple word completions
- ✅ You want phrase predictions
- ✅ You prefer a straightforward API
- ✅ You have limited memory constraints
- ✅ You need quick implementation

### Choose Suggestions Library When:

- ✅ You need advanced typing suggestions
- ✅ You want confidence scores and rich metadata
- ✅ You need customizable filtering and sorting
- ✅ You're working with large corpora
- ✅ You need performance optimization
- ✅ You want context-aware predictions
- ✅ You need word similarity matching
- ✅ You want to merge multiple data sources

## Migration Guide

### From Autocomplete to Suggestions

**Before (Autocomplete):**

```typescript
const service = new Autocomplete();
service.train(corpus);
const completions = service.getCompletions('tech');
```

**After (Suggestions):**

```typescript
const engine = new TypingSuggestions();
engine.processCorpus(corpus);
const completions = engine.getCompletions('tech');
// Access word: completions[0].word
// Access frequency: completions[0].frequency
// Access confidence: completions[0].confidence
```

### Key Differences to Note:

1. **Return Types**: Autocomplete returns `string[]`, Suggestions returns `SuggestionResult[]`
2. **Method Names**: `train()` → `processCorpus()`
3. **Data Access**: Direct strings vs objects with metadata
4. **Options**: Limited vs extensive customization options

## Testing

Run the comparison demo to see both libraries in action:

```bash
bun run lib/suggestions/comparison-demo.ts
```

This will show side-by-side results for the same corpus and test scenarios.

## Conclusion

Both libraries serve different purposes:

- **Autocomplete Library**: Perfect for simple, lightweight autocomplete needs
- **Suggestions Library**: Ideal for advanced, feature-rich typing suggestions

The Suggestions library is a natural evolution that builds upon the Autocomplete library's foundation while adding significant improvements in performance, features, and flexibility.

# Product Requirements Document: Simple Markdown Editor with Auto-completion

## Introduction/Overview

This document outlines the requirements for a simple markdown editor with content-based auto-completion functionality. The editor will serve as a standalone component for content creation (blog posts, documentation) that can be embedded anywhere in the application. It will provide a WYSIWYG-style interface with markdown syntax highlighting, targeting a mixed audience of both technical and non-technical users.

## Goals

1. **Create an intuitive markdown editing experience** that accommodates both technical and non-technical users
2. **Implement content-based auto-completion** to enhance writing productivity and reduce typing effort
3. **Provide comprehensive markdown support** including basic formatting, advanced features, and real-time preview
4. **Build a reusable standalone component** that can be easily integrated into different parts of the application
5. **Ensure ease of implementation** by prioritizing simplicity and maintainability

## User Stories

1. **As a content creator**, I want to write markdown content with auto-completion suggestions so that I can write faster and more efficiently.

2. **As a technical user**, I want to see markdown syntax highlighting in a WYSIWYG interface so that I can maintain control over the markup while having a visual preview.

3. **As a non-technical user**, I want an intuitive editing interface that suggests content completions so that I can focus on writing without worrying about markdown syntax.

4. **As a developer**, I want a standalone editor component so that I can easily embed it in different parts of the application.

5. **As a user**, I want my content to be automatically saved to local storage so that I don't lose my work if the browser refreshes.

## Functional Requirements

1. **Editor Interface**

   - The system must provide a WYSIWYG-style editor with markdown syntax highlighting
   - The system must display real-time preview of the rendered markdown content
   - The system must support both edit and preview modes with seamless switching

2. **Markdown Support**

   - The system must support basic formatting: bold, italic, headers, and lists
   - The system must support advanced features: tables, code blocks, links, and images
   - The system must render markdown syntax in real-time as the user types

3. **Auto-completion Functionality**

   - The system must provide content-based suggestions (word/sentence completion)
   - The system must display suggestions in a dropdown or popup interface
   - The system must allow users to accept suggestions with keyboard shortcuts (Tab/Enter)
   - The system must allow users to dismiss suggestions (Escape key)

4. **Content Management**

   - The system must automatically save content to local storage
   - The system must restore content from local storage when the editor is reloaded
   - The system must provide a way to clear/reset the editor content

5. **Component Integration**

   - The system must be implemented as a standalone React component
   - The system must accept props for configuration (placeholder text, initial content, etc.)
   - The system must emit events for content changes and user interactions
   - The system must be easily embeddable in any part of the application

6. **User Experience**
   - The system must provide keyboard shortcuts for common markdown operations
   - The system must show visual feedback for active formatting
   - The system must handle edge cases gracefully (empty content, large documents, etc.)

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

1. **Collaborative editing** - This is a single-user editor, not a collaborative tool
2. **Database integration** - Content will be saved to local storage only
3. **Export functionality** - No PDF or HTML export features
4. **Advanced auto-completion** - No AI-powered suggestions or complex NLP features
5. **Plugin system** - No extensible plugin architecture
6. **Version control** - No document history or versioning features

## Design Considerations

- **Editor Library**: Use Tiptap for ease of implementation and good markdown support
- **UI Components**: Leverage existing Catalyst components for consistency
- **Responsive Design**: Ensure the editor works well on different screen sizes
- **Accessibility**: Follow WCAG guidelines for keyboard navigation and screen readers
- **Performance**: Optimize for smooth typing experience with large documents

## Technical Considerations

- **Framework**: Implement as a React component using TypeScript
- **State Management**: Use React state for editor content and UI state
- **Local Storage**: Use browser's localStorage API for content persistence
- **Auto-completion**: Implement a simple word-based suggestion system
- **Markdown Parsing**: Use a lightweight markdown parser for real-time rendering
- **Styling**: Use Tailwind CSS for styling, consistent with existing design system

## Success Metrics

1. **User Engagement**: Users complete writing tasks 20% faster with auto-completion
2. **Adoption Rate**: 80% of users utilize the auto-completion feature within first week
3. **Error Reduction**: 50% reduction in markdown syntax errors
4. **Performance**: Editor responds to typing within 16ms (60fps)
5. **Reliability**: 99% uptime for auto-save functionality

## Open Questions

1. **Auto-completion Algorithm**: Should we implement a simple word frequency-based system or integrate with an existing library?
2. **Suggestion Timing**: When should auto-completion suggestions appear (after 2 characters, 3 characters, etc.)?
3. **Content Limits**: Should there be a maximum document size for performance reasons?
4. **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Which specific keyboard shortcuts should be supported beyond the standard ones?
5. **Error Handling**: How should we handle localStorage quota exceeded errors?

## Implementation Priority

**Phase 1 (MVP):**

- Basic WYSIWYG editor with markdown support
- Simple content-based auto-completion
- Local storage persistence
- Real-time preview

**Phase 2 (Enhancement):**

- Advanced markdown features (tables, code blocks)
- Improved auto-completion algorithm
- Keyboard shortcuts
- Better error handling

**Phase 3 (Polish):**

- Performance optimizations
- Accessibility improvements
- Advanced UI features
- Documentation and examples
